# Cloudflared Tunnel Variables
#
# IMPORTANT: You need to set these variables before running the playbook:
# 1. tunnel_name: A friendly name for your tunnel
# 2. tunnel_uuid: The UUID generated when you create the tunnel
# 3. domain_name: Your domain name
# 4. services: List of services to expose
#
# Path clarification:
# - local_credentials_path: Path on YOUR DEV MACHINE (where you run ansible)
# - All /etc/cloudflared paths: Paths on the TARGET VM (where cloudflared runs)

# Example configuration - REPLACE WITH YOUR VALUES:
tunnel_name: "yimple-tunnel"
tunnel_uuid: "9cd59442-860b-4efe-ab10-82a185a432c8" # Get this from 'cloudflared tunnel create'

# Optional: Custom path to credentials on your dev machine
# Default: ~/.cloudflared/{{ tunnel_uuid }}.json
# local_credentials_path: "/path/to/your/credentials.json"

# Services to expose through the tunnel
services:
  # Scraper service
  - hostname: "scraper.yimple.com"
    service: "http://localhost:3000" # Scraper service
    description: "Web scraper service"
